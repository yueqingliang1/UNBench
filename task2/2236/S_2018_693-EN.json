and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping operations by 2020.\nWelcoming the improvement in security conditions while expressing concern that the security situation in Darfur remains precarious due to the destabilising activities of a number of actors, including elements of some armed movements, auxiliary units of the Government of Sudan forces and militia groups, and which further exacerbate insecurity, threats against civilians in Darfur, inter-communal violence, acts of criminality, and the lack of development and rule of law,\n\nWelcoming the reduction of military confrontations between Government forces and rebel groups, noting the announcement of unilateral cessations of hostilities by the Government of Sudan and by the Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minnawi (SLA/MM), the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)/Gibril and the Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council (SLM-TC),\n\nExpressing concern at ongoing clashes in Jebel Marra, which have resulted

in inter-communal violence and criminality,\n\nReiterating its demand that all parties to the conflict in Darfur immediately end violence, including attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel,\n\nNoting that, notwithstanding the significant decrease in inter-communal conflicts, they remain one of the main sources of violence in Darfur and expressing concern at ongoing inter-communal conflicts over land, access to water and other resources, migration issues and tribal rivalries, including with the involvement of paramilitary units and tribal militias, as well as at

policing, corrections and judiciary, noting that rule of law capacity remains limited, urging the Government of Sudan to consolidate and expand its efforts to end impunity and to enhance the protective environment for the civilian population, without any discrimination, particularly with respect to violations and abuses of women\u2019s rights and sexual and gender-based violence as well

reduction in the number of reported cases of human rights violations and abuses, while recognising UNAMID\u2019s reduced ability to monitor and verify reported human rights violations and abuses in the areas from which it has withdrawn and expressing concern that IDPs continue to face grave security threats including being killed, raped, or harassed as they conduct life-sustaining activities outside the camps and the worrying levels of sexual and gender-based violence and grave violations against children, as well as findings in February 2018 from the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict that indicated an increase in sexual violence against children in Darfur, that victims of sexual violence often face denial, shame and stigma preventing them from reporting the crime or seeking assistance, further compounding their suffering, and denial of justice and accountability,\n\nEncouraging the Government of Sudan to swiftly ensure that the UNAMID team sites already handed over and team sites that will be handed over in the future are utilised in line with the agreements made between UNAMID and Government of Sudan,\n\nUnderlining the importance of the Government of Sudan addressing the root causes of conflict and extending state authority, including through the strengthening of the rule of law and respect

implementation, and urging all parties to immediately re-engage in negotiations with the AUHIP on the Roadmap to make immediate progress on the implementation of the Roadmap, including the signing of

remain in place, including restrictions from the Government of Sudan on the conduct of night patrols all over Darfur and restrictions preventing UNAMID and humanitarian actors from reaching areas where there are instances of conflict in a timely fashion in response to the ongoing reports of violent incidents in the Jebel Marra area, and that obstacles, including bureaucratic obstacles, imposed
