the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of non\u2011interference, good\u2011neighbourliness and regional cooperation,\nRecalling that the CAR bears the primary responsibility to protect all populations within its territory from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,\nNoting with concern that while improving, the security situation in the CAR remains fragile, due to the continued presence of armed groups and other armed spoilers, as well as the ongoing violence, the lack of capacity of the national security forces, the limited authority of the State over all of the CAR territory, and the persistence of the root causes of the conflict,\nEmphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be CAR\u2011owned, including the political process, and should prioritize reconciliation of the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, including, those displaced by the crisis,\nCalling upon the CAR authorities to urgently implement transparent and inclusive measures that allow for stabilization and reconciliation in the CAR, including to take concrete steps to restore the effective authority of the State over all of the territory of the CAR; to fight impunity by restoring administration of the judiciary and the criminal justice system, including the penitentiary system, throughout the country; to speed up the reform of the CAR Armed Forces (FACA) and internal security forces in order to put in place multi \u2011ethnic, professional, and republican security services through appropriate security sector reform processes; to carry out the inclusive and effective disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation (DDRR) of armed groups, including children formerly associated with\nthem; and to establish a functioning public financial management in order to meet\n           the expenses related to the functioning of the State, implement early recovery plans,\n           and revitalize the economy,\n                  Encouraging the CAR authorities, in collaboration with the United Nations\n           Multidimensional Integrated Mission in the CAR (MINUSCA) and the European\n           Union Training Mission in the CAR (EUTM\u2011RCA), to provide equal opportunities\n           for members of armed groups, whether anti\u2011Balaka or ex\u2011S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, in the process of\n           selecting eligible demobilized members to integrate into the national security and\n           defence forces, and to ensure that FACA soldiers of all prefectures enjoy equal\n           access to the registration and simplified verification process,\n                  Underlining the importance of rebuilding a multi\u2011ethnic, republican and\n           professional national army in the CAR, recognizing in this regard the work carried\n           out by the EUTM\u2011RCA and welcoming the intention of Member States of the\n           Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) to contribute to the\n           training of the national security and defence forces in support of the CAR\n           authorities and in coordination with EUTM,\n                  Calling upon the CAR authorities to ensure that perpetrators of violations of\n           applicable international law, including those committed against children and\n           women, are excluded from the CAR security and armed forces,\n                  Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary\u2011General to enforce strictly his\n           zero\u2011tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, expressing grave concern\n           over numerous allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse reportedly committed by\n           peacekeepers in the CAR, stressing the urgent need for troop\u2011 and police\u2011\n           contributing countries and MINUSCA to promptly investigate those cases in a\n           credible and transparent manner and to hold accountable those responsible for such\n           criminal offenses or misconduct, and further stressing the need to prevent such\n           exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are addressed,\n                  Welcoming the Secretary\u2011General\u2019s Report of 29 September

Experts on the CAR established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013),\n           expanded by resolution 2134 (2014) and extended pursuant to resolution 2262\n           (2016), and taking note of the Panel of Experts\u2019 recommendations,\n                  Strongly condemning the ongoing violence and instability in the CAR, and the\n           threats of violence, human rights violations and abuses and international\n           humanitarian law violations, including against women and children; the attacks\n           against United Nations peacekeepers, international forces and humanitarian\n           personnel; the continuous cycle of provocations and reprisals by armed groups, both\n           inside and outside Bangui and denial of humanitarian access, committed by armed\n           elements, which continue to adversely affect the dire humanitarian situation faced\n           by the civilian population and to impede humanitarian access to vulnerable\n           populations,\n                  Stressing the urgent and imperative need to end impunity in the CAR and to\n           bring to justice perpetrators of these acts, some of which may amount to crimes\n           under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), to which the\nCAR is a State party, noting in this regard the opening by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on 24 September 2014 of an investigation following the request of the national authorities on alleged crimes committed since 2012 and welcoming the ongoing cooperation by the CAR authorities in this regard,\n                 Stressing the importance of putting in place an effective national judicial system, underlining the need to bolster national accountability mechanisms, including through

investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed in the CAR, and recalling the importance of continuous support of the international community to this process pursued by the CAR authorities,\n

process, target civilians and attack peacekeepers may meet criteria for designation under sanctions as stated in this resolution,\n                 Expressing concern that illicit trafficking, trade, exploitation and smuggling of natural resources including gold, diamonds and wildlife has a negative impact in the economy and the development of the country, and that it continues to threaten the peace and stability of the CAR,\n                 Taking note of the Kimberley Process (KP) Administrative Decision on Resumption of Exports of Rough Diamonds from the CAR, its annexed Operational Framework, and the work of the KP Monitoring Team for CAR and recognizing the extraordinary efforts of the CAR Authorities and the KP, to responsibly and progressively, through pre\u2011established \u201ccompliant zones\u201d, reintegrate the CAR into the global diamond trade,\n                 Noting with concern the findings of the Panel of Experts\u2019 final report that the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) remains active in the CAR, has established links to other armed groups and is generating revenues from the exploitation and trade of natural resources, including gold, diamonds and wildlife poaching,\n                 Further noting with concern the ongoing transnational criminal activity in the region, emphasizing the risk of the situation in the CAR providing a conducive environment for further transnational criminal activities, such as those involving arms trafficking and the use of mercenaries as well as a potential breeding ground for radical networks,\n                 Acknowledging in this respect the important contribution the Council\u2011mandated arms embargo can make to countering the illicit transfer of arms and related materiel in the CAR and its region, and in supporting post\u2011conflict peacebuilding, DDRR and SSR processes, recalling its resolutions 2117 (2013), 2127 (2013), 2220 (2015) and 2262 (2016) and expressing grave concern at the threat

play in this regard and encouraging efforts to further enhance cooperation and implementation of the sanctions regime in all its aspects,\nNoting with concern the reports that sanctioned individuals
