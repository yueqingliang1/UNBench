                "statement": "At the outset, I wish to welcome the first day of the British presidency of the Security Council.\nSince 2004, the European Union (EU) has played a fundamental role in the stability and security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region through the European Union Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It does so on behalf of the international community, in accordance with the Dayton-Paris accord and upon decision of the Security Council. The operation, in which France is fully engaged, has shown that it plays an essential role in ensuring a secure environment, reassuring the population and deterring potential destabilizing actors, in a context that is nevertheless marked by persistent political tensions and worrisome provocations. We therefore welcome the unanimous adoption today by the Council of resolution 2757 (2024), which renews its mandate for a period of 12 months.\nWith regard to the civilian component, France reiterates that it supports the mandate of the High Representative. France expresses its full solidarity with Bosnia and Herzegovina following the severe flooding and landslides that hit the country on 3 October. France welcomes the holding of local elections on 6 October despite those dramatic events. It notes that, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observation mission, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, these elections were competitive and managed effectively, despite a number of observed shortcomings.\nFrance, as a witness to the Dayton-Paris accords, firmly supports the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We remain very concerned by the initiatives by the Republika Srpska authorities, which threaten the unity, constitutional order, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, principles at the heart of the Dayton-Paris agreements.\nFrance is convinced that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, like that of the entire Western Balkans region, lies in the European Union. The decision taken by the European Council to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina on 21 March was a clear signal in that regard. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a unique opportunity to move forward on its path to European Union accession. France calls on the Bosnian authorities to work together to implement the eight key measures and move forward on the appointment.\nof a chief negotiator, in order to advance Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in its European Union accession process,\nfor the benefit of all its citizens."

                "statement": "I congratulate you, Madam President, for assuming\nthe presidency of the Security Council for the month\nof November, and I assure you of my delegation\u2019s\nfull support. Since you have already congratulated\nSwitzerland on behalf of the Council for its excellent\npresidency during the month of October, I will not add\nanything further.\n       I welcome the Chairman of the Presidency of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Denis Be\u0107irovi\u0107, as well\nas the delegations of Croatia, Serbia and the European\nUnion, to today\u2019s meeting.\n       I also thank the delegation of France for its efforts\nin facilitating the adoption of resolution 2757 (2024),\nwhich renews the authorization of the European Union\nMilitary Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\ncontinues to play a key role in maintaining the stability\nand security of the country.\n       The progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina\nsince the end of the devastating conflict almost 30\nyears ago is commendable. The country\u2019s progress in\nbuilding an environment of peace and development,\nachieved with the support of the international\ncommunity \u2014 and above all thanks to the resilience\nof the Bosnian people \u2014 deserves to be preserved.\nThe comprehensive implementation of the General\nFramework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is essential to that end and to ensure\nthe strengthening of an inclusive and democratic\nsystem that represents all its citizens. For that reason,\ncertain positions that challenge the authority of State\ninstitutions and the framework of the Dayton Peace\nAgreement remain worrisome.\n       Ecuador reiterates its call on all political\nstakeholders to abandon any rhetoric or action that\nfuels divisions or separatist aspirations. Respect for\nthe country\u2019s constitutional, legal and institutional\nframework is the cornerstone for achieving peace,\nstability and progress. Ecuador welcomes the fact\nthat the recent local elections have been held in\nan atmosphere of peace and transparency. It also\nrecognizes the efforts of the Bosnian authorities to\nimprove electoral integrity, although there is still a\nneed to increase women\u2019s full, equal and meaningful\nparticipation in political life. Similarly, it is important\nto continue to address the spread of hate speech, which\nthreatens to undermine trust among communities and\nhinders efforts for national unity.\n       In the area of European integration, Ecuador\nbelieves that the prospect of accession is a valuable\ngoal for Bosnia and Herzegovina and therefore urges\nnational leaders to responsibly honour the necessary\ncommitments to ensure the future of European\nintegration in their country.\n       Ecuador again calls on the international community\nto continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in\nits mission to consolidate peace and sustainable\ndevelopment and to create a prosperous future for the\nnext generations. Women and young people play a\ncritical role in that effort. We encourage the authorities\nto step up efforts for the full implementation of the\ncommitments, conditions and objectives established\nin the 5+2 agenda, which will allow the completion of\nthe international monitoring process. In the nearly two\nyears that Ecuador has exercised the responsibility of\nbeing a member of the Council, Ecuador has reaffirmed\nits firm support for the unity, sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with\ninternational law and the Dayton Peace Agreement. I\nreiterate that support today."

                "country": "Slovenia",
                "statement": "I want to congratulate\nyou, Madam President, on assuming the presidency\nof the Security Council. I can express our full support\nand constructive collaboration during the month of\nNovember. I want to congratulate Switzerland for\na very capable and smooth presidency in the month\nof October.\n       I would like to welcome the Chairman of the\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Denis\nBe\u0107irovi\u0107, to the Chamber. I also want to welcome the\nrepresentatives of Croatia and Serbia.\n       At the outset, I would like to express our unwavering\nsolidarity and support for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nSlovenia was among the first countries to dispatch a\nteam of rescuers through the European Union (EU)\nCivil Protection Mechanism after the flooding and\nlandslides last month. We remember with gratitude that\nBosnia and Herzegovina showed equal support for our\ncountry last year.\n       Today I would like to speak about commitments,\nhighlighting the following three points.\nFirst, I would like to highlight the Security Council\u2019s unanimous approval for extending the authorization of the European Union (EU) Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea), underscoring our joint commitment to peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. EUFOR-Althea\u2019s presence remains an important source of reassurance for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It supports the ongoing journey towards lasting peace, unity and integration into the EU.\n\nSecondly, Slovenia remains unequivocally committed to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s EU perspective. The EU has clearly recognized that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is with the European Union, which is the wish and resolve of the great majority of citizens of all ethnic groups. Only the steadfast commitment of all political stakeholders to European integration and local ownership of the reform processes can bring about progress for achieving that strategic goal. Slovenia urges political leaders to intensify efforts in key reform areas, including by submitting a comprehensive reform agenda under the Reform and Growth Facility for the Western Balkans. We also encourage active civic participation and engagement from other parts of society. Strengthening broad internal dialogue will not only support the reform process but also enhance public trust in democratic institutions.\n\nThirdly and lastly, Slovenia expects all political actors to commit to upholding Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and constitutional order. Ensuring those principles is essential for fostering stability, democratic resilience and mutual trust. In other words, the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be respected and upheld. Secessionist rhetoric and challenges to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s constitutional order from the Republika Srpska pose a threat to the principles I mentioned earlier and could endanger the country\u2019s path to EU membership. Slovenia urges all relevant stakeholders to refrain from such acts and to demonstrate tolerance and engage actively in inter-ethnic dialogue towards reconciliation. As a positive development, Slovenia welcomes the preliminary findings of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights election observation mission, which indicated that the local elections held on 6 October were competitive and efficiently managed.\n\nIn conclusion, let me refer to the recently adopted Pact for the Future (General Assembly resolution 79/1), which reaffirms our shared commitment to sustainable development, peace and prosperity for future generations. The Declaration on Future Generations contained in annex II of the Pact should inspire Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue advancing reforms that strengthen democratic governance, the justice system and economic resilience. By championing those principles, Bosnia and Herzegovina can build a stronger and resilient future that leads to membership of the EU. In turn, the initiation of EU accession talks represents an opportunity for economic growth, enabling all citizens, especially young people, to envision a prosperous future within their own country.\n\nLast but not least, I would like to welcome the report submitted by the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and thank him and his Office for their work and endeavours."

I also welcome the delegations of the European Union, Serbia and Croatia to today\u2019s meeting.\n\nSwitzerland welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 2757 (2024) renewing the authorization for the European Union Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea). We thank France for its efforts as penholder. EUFOR-Althea remains an essential pillar of stability, preserving security not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina but also in the region. We are honoured to have facilitated the renewal of the authorization last year. True to its long-standing commitment, Switzerland will continue to contribute to the mission by deploying military personnel and specialized experts.\n\nWe also thank the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina for his report and reiterate our support for his Office. The completion of the 5+2 agenda, which\nis the condition for the closure of the Office, remains\nour declared objective. We note with regret the lack of\nsubstantial progress in that respect.\n     Switzerland      welcomes      the   peaceful     and   orderly\nconduct     of  this   month\u2019s     local   elections     in   Bosnia\nand    Herzegovina,       which     demonstrated       respect     for\nfundamental freedoms. The participation of all parties\nunderlines the commitment to democratic principles.\nHowever,      we    remain     concerned      by    the   persistent\nunderrepresentation of women in public and political\nlife and call for redoubled efforts to increase their\npresence in political processes.\n     We    call    on   all  political    actors    to   seize    this\nopportunity      and    electoral    momentum        to   invest    in\nthe   well-being     of   the   entire   population      of   Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. A common path, based on trust, is\nessential to forging a united and inclusive society that\npromotes cooperation, prosperity and security for all.\nTo that end, it is incumbent on the country\u2019s leaders\nto  demonstrate       political    will   and    pursue    essential\nreforms. That is a fundamental step towards Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s accession to the European Union.\n     However,        trends     towards      hate     speech,     the\ndistortion of history and the glorification of war crimes\nworry us, as they undermine trust and are detrimental\nto   all   societies.    Such     rhetoric    prevents     progress\ntowards a peaceful, multi-ethnic society. Inter-ethnic\nreconciliation      is  necessary     to   create    a  climate     of\nmutual respect and understanding between different\ncommunities. Addressing past atrocities and preventing\ngenocide denial are essential to ensuring lasting peace\nand    a  stable    future.    Switzerland      also   rejects    any\nsecessionist rhetoric or actions, such as those emanating\nfrom the Republika Srpska in recent months, which\nundermine the country\u2019s unity, constitutional integrity\nand rule of law.\n     This    is  the  final   mandated      meeting      on   Bosnia\nand    Herzegovina       under    Switzerland\u2019s      current    term\non the Council. I would like to take this opportunity\nto reiterate Switzerland\u2019s unwavering support for the\ncountry\u2019s     sovereignty      and    territorial   integrity.    We\nremain committed to supporting peace and security,\nprosperity and good governance in the country and\nthe region.\n     The    year    2025    will   mark     30   years    since   the\nDayton     Accords.      Switzerland      therefore     invites   the\ninternational community and stakeholders in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina to seize this opportunity to promote\na shared and promising vision, particularly for the\nyounger generations, who embody the future of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina."

I\nalso wish to commend Switzerland for its successful\npresidency during the month of October.\n     I acknowledge the contribution of the Office of\nthe High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\nexecuting its mandate in accordance with the Dayton\nPeace Agreement and take note of the contents of\nthe report submitted on the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.

We express\nour solidarity with those whose lives have been affected\nby that tragedy and commend the swift coordination\nefforts at the national, regional and international levels,\nwhich saved many lives and avoided further damage to\nvital infrastructure in the affected areas.\n     Permit me to also congratulate the local authorities\nand the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the\npeaceful conduct of local elections in October. We note\nfrom the report of the joint observation mission of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s\nOffice for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\nthat   the   elections    were     efficiently    prepared,     with\nfundamental       freedoms       respected.     Regrettably,      we\nalso noted that there continues to be a persistently\nlow level of women\u2019s participation in political life. We\nurge that more concrete measures be taken to address\nthat troubling trend and to enhance women\u2019s political\nparticipation and leadership in the country.\n     Guyana notes the positive developments, notably\nthe  March     2024     decision    of  the   European      Council\nto   open    accession      negotiations      with    Bosnia     and\nHerzegovina.

They each stand to\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nbenefit tremendously from the free flow of goods,\n\nservices and people in the region, which will no doubt\ncontribute to the economic growth and stability of the\ncountry and the wider Balkan region.\nWe encourage continued collaboration to achieve\nthat goal, as agreed by the two entities \u2014 the Federation\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.\nIn that vein, we welcome today\u2019s unanimous\nadoption of resolution 2757 (2024). The resolution\nrenewed the authorization of the European Union\nmilitary operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\ncontinues to play an important stabilizing role in the\ncountry and region.\nWhile noting the positive developments, we remain\nconcerned about the reported continued divisive\nrhetoric that threatens the political stability and,\nultimately, the security of the country. Guyana urges\nthe political leaders to prioritize the interests of all\ncitizens and underscores the importance of upholding\nthe provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement. We\nfurther encourage all relevant stakeholders to act in\naccordance with those provisions.\nThe report of the Office of the High Representative\nhighlights the inequalities faced by women,\nparticularly in the labour market and in the education\nand political sectors. We believe that the inclusion\nand participation of women in all sectors and at\nthe highest levels significantly contributes to the\ndevelopment of a country. Their perspectives can lead\nto sustainable solutions, notably in building peace\nand resolving conflict. In that regard, we welcome the\nimplementation of the women and peace and security\nagenda by local ministries and relevant authorities\nwith the support of the Peacebuilding Fund. We also\ncommend the implementation of programmes geared\ntowards the empowerment of youth.

Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s stability\nis crucial to preventing regional conflict. The United\nStates remains committed to the principles of the\nDayton Peace Accords and the joint goal of an inclusive,\nmulti-ethnic, democratic, peaceful and prosperous\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Rooted in the Dayton Peace\nAccords, EUFOR-Althea remains critical in supporting\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and multi-ethnic\ncharacter of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We thank the\nEU for its contributions to and leadership of EUFOR-\nAlthea.\nWe have been alarmed by recent rhetoric and\nactions undermining Dayton, as well as Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s stability, constitutional structure and\nterritorial integrity. We must continue to protect\nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s State-level institutions from\nactors who seek to weaken them. Threats of secession,\nunilateral withdrawal and the establishment of parallel\ninstitutions are dangerous and unacceptable. They\ndistract from the important electoral, economic and\nrule of law reforms under way.\nBosnia and Herzegovina faces additional challenges,\nincluding stagnation and rampant corruption. We\nurge local authorities to set aside personal and\ndivide agendas in order to focus on issues of mutual\nconcern. Corruption only exacerbates the challenge of\ne-thno-nationalism. The High Representative for Bosnia\nand Herzegovina plays a crucial role in strengthening\ninstitutions and promoting reforms as central to the\nsecurity of all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nregardless of ethnicity. The United States fully supports\nHigh Representative Christian Schmidt in his ability to\nexercise all necessary authority, including the Bonn\npowers, until the 5+2 agenda has been fulfilled. We\nalso fully support Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s path to\nEU membership. The Bonn powers complement the EU\naccession process and facilitate reform efforts along the\nEU path. The United States will continue to use all tools\nin its toolbox, including sanctions, to push back against\nthose who seek to undermine the Dayton Agreement,\nand we encourage others to do the same.\nIn conclusion, now as ever, the United States supports Bosnia and Herzegovina as it works to secure the future that all its citizens deserve.

We promise you, Madam President, our full support.\nMy delegation welcomes Mr. Denis Be\u0107irovi\u0107, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the participation of the delegations of the European Union, Serbia and Croatia at today\u2019s meeting. We also welcome the renewal of the authorization of the European Union (EU) Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea). It has proven to be vital in maintaining stability in the region and will continue to receive our support.\nAs the thirtieth anniversary of the Dayton Peace Agreement approaches, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made many positive strides thanks to that historic accord and the efforts of its people to honour the spirit of reconciliation that was forged in 1995. The revised electoral laws put into practice for the first time in last month\u2019s local elections are just one example of the developments achieved. After Bosnia and Herzegovina was granted status EU candidate status in December 2022, the European Union decided to initiate accession negotiations with the country last March. Indeed, it is a welcome development and a milestone in its history, but disruptive forces still remain a threat to Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s unity. In order to justify the EU\u2019s faith in the region\u2019s progress, it must continue the positive steps it has taken and reinforce the political and economic reforms that it has put into place to date.\nWith that in mind, we would like to focus on a few key points.\nFirst, we reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is the bedrock of the Dayton Agreement and essential to maintaining long-term peace and stability in the region. The still-fragile State institutions continue to be threatened and the authority of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Constitutional Court to be routinely challenged if not openly defied. Such actions threaten not only the effectiveness of those bodies but also the full implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. While there have been many positive developments, a number of challenges still remain, such as constitutional reform and an increase in the level of women\u2019s political participation. We expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue to expedite the required political and economic reforms towards a peaceful and prosperous future.\nSecondly, for national unity to prevail in the country, it is vital that all parties move in unison towards the common goal of implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement. While we are well aware that for many the trauma of the recent past remains a present-day reality, there is no other way forward than through dialogue, compromise and reconciliation. We appeal to all parties to avoid all actions and rhetoric that contradict the statehood, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to advance their sincere efforts to chart a positive future. Inflammatory political speech and the denial of past atrocities must be condemned and marginalized by those in positions of authority.\nThirdly, we would like to reiterate our support for the mandate of EUFOR-Althea. We also support the valuable efforts of the High Representative to ensure the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and lay the groundwork for a strong democracy.\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Korea urges all parties to focus on working towards a positive future that will benefit every citizen and endow future generations with a peaceful and prosperous Bosnia and Herzegovina."

We also welcome the peaceful atmosphere in which the recent local\nelections were held and commend the efficient run-up\n\nto the elections, as well as the extensive participation\nfrom across the political spectrum. Unfortunately,\nwomen remain underrepresented in public and political\nlife.

However, Malta remains concerned about\nthe lack of progress in relation to the political situation.\nSecessionist rhetoric and actions are still rife and pose\nserious obstacles to economic and social development,\nand also put the stable but fragile security situation\nat risk.\n      We are deeply concerned about any legislative\ninitiatives that run counter to the constitutional order\nof the country and its path towards EU membership\nand we call for restraint in adopting and implementing\nsuch measures. In that context, we reiterate our call on\nall members of the country\u2019s leadership to refrain from\nnationalistic and inflammatory rhetoric and divisive\nactions, as they would seriously threaten peace and\nstability in the country and potentially in the wider\nregion. We reiterate our position on the importance of\nsustained stability in the Western Balkans, which is\ninterlinked with the overall prosperity of the region.\n      Malta strongly believes that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s future lies within the EU and will\ncontinue to support its commitment towards achieving\nits goal of EU membership.

We encourage the implementation of the\nnecessary reforms and the strengthening of the country\u2019s\nconstitutional, electoral and judicial frameworks,\nwhich will ensure meaningful progress towards EU\naccession.

We strongly encourage all\nparties to work together to enact coherent legislation\nthrough coordinated institutions. That is the only way\nto achieve meaningful reforms and address future\nchallenges. A genuine commitment from all parties to\nreconciliation and building stronger cohesion is urgently\nneeded. All parties should strive for compromise\nsolutions that are beneficial for all citizens of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity. That calls\nfor a commitment to confidence-building measures\nthat are aimed at boosting mutual understanding and\nfostering increased cooperation.\n     Malta reaffirms its unwavering support for the\nDayton Peace Agreement. Next year will mark 30\nyears since the signing of the Agreement. We urge\nall parties within Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully\nand scrupulously respect and uphold the principles\nenshrined within it, including the power-sharing\nframework, and work in a constructive manner within\nthe agreed parameters. We also reiterate our support\nfor the mission and mandate of the High Representative\nfor Bosnia and Herzegovina and his Office and its\nrole in overseeing the implementation of the Dayton\nPeace Agreement.\n     Finally, I would like to express Malta\u2019s continued\nstrong support for Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s unity\nand territorial integrity. We also urge for political\nresponsibility and sensible leadership in the country\nwith a view to achieving cooperation based on respect\nfor all members of society and with a clear view towards\nEU accession. Serious efforts are needed to engage in\na constructive and inclusive dialogue that guarantees\npeaceful coexistence and a prospective and prosperous\nfuture for all citizens in the region."

                "statement": "I thank you, Madam\nPresident, for convening this debate, and congratulate\nthe United Kingdom on assuming the presidency of the\nSecurity Council for the month of November. I assure\nyou of Sierra Leone\u2019s full support. I also congratulate the\ndelegation of Switzerland for its successful presidency\nduring the month of October. I welcome the participation\nin this meeting of the delegations of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Serbia, Croatia and the European Union\n(EU).\n     Sierra Leone takes this opportunity to express its\nsympathy for the loss of lives and property as a result of\nthe flooding and landslides in five central municipalities\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina in early October. As the\nimpacts of climate change heighten, it is imperative that\nwe curtail human activities that threaten our collective\nwell-being and a stable and sustainable future.\n     We welcome the adoption of resolution 2757 (2024),\nwhich renews the authorization of the European Union\nMilitary Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose\npresence is critical to sustaining stabilization efforts\n\nin   Bosnia    and    Herzegovina,      and    we   are   optimistic\nthat    today\u2019s    vote    is   indicative     of   the    Council\u2019s\ndetermination       to  ensure    the   continued     security    and\nsafety of the region. Our delegation notes the detailed\nreport for the period 16 April to 15 October submitted\nby   Mr.   Christian     Schmidt,      High    Representative      for\nBosnia     and     Herzegovina,        through     the    Secretary-\nGeneral. We commend the High Representative for the\nprogress achieved during that period. We recognize the\nimportance of his efforts, particularly with regard to the\nsuccessful conduct of elections and the vital impact of\nthe reform elements introduced, ensuring compliance\nwith transparency and integrity standards, regulating\nthe participation of persons convicted of crimes under\ninternational criminal law, the use of technology, and the\ncurbing of divisive and hateful campaign rhetoric.\n      The significance of building trust in the electoral\nsystem    \u2014 and by extension in the Office of the High\nRepresentative \u2014 cannot be overemphasized. Moreover,\nthe successful local elections demonstrated that with\ncoordination       and    cooperation       among      Bosnia     and\nHerzegovina\u2019s       stakeholders,      much    can    be   achieved.\nWe    therefore     reaffirm    our   support     for  Bosnia     and\nHerzegovina\u2019s territorial integrity and its internationally\nrecognized borders and strongly condemn all actions\nthat seek to undermine not only the current governance\nstructure but also the progress made in the implementation\nof the existing peace agreement and adherence with\nconditions for EU integration.\n      Sierra Leone is mindful , however, that the efforts of\nthe High Representative and some arms of Government\nare   being    impaired     by   certain    actors,   leading    to   a\nstagnation in the EU accession process and a lag in\nthe implementation of the 5+2 agenda, which has had\na cascading effect on other avenues for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s advancement, including agreement on the\ndraft reform agenda. It is unfortunate that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina missed the opportunity to benefit from the\ngrowth plan for the Western Balkans, which would have\nstimulated the country\u2019s decelerating economic growth.\n      In   the   light   of   everything      I  just    mentioned,\nfirst, Sierra Leone renews its call in this Chamber\nfor   collaborative      leadership,     strong     institutions    of\nGovernment that uphold the rule of law and protect\nhuman rights, and national development within the\nscope    of   regional    integration.     While     we   commend\nthe   efforts   of   the   European      Union     and    the   wider\ninternational community, Sierra Leone is convinced that\n\ncollaboration among the leadership of the Federation\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska\nis  the   cornerstone      for   the   country\u2019s     stability    and\ndevelopment. The reports of parallel structures and\ndiscriminatory policies being promulgated along with\nsecessionist     rhetoric,    particularly     in  the   Republika\nSrpska, are deeply concerning. We strongly urge the\nRepublika Srpska authorities to cease all actions that\nundermine the integrity of the unified State of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and compound any existing political\nand ethnic divides. We urge that all efforts be directed\ntowards State-building in good faith and participation in\ndecision-making, with effective public administration\nand good governance and in a manner that strengthens\nthe unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole.\n     Secondly, we believe that the Constitution, as the\ncountry\u2019s highest legal authority, must reflect its highest\naspirations. Acknowledging Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s\nmulti-ethnic      and    multicultural      characteristics,       we\ncall  for  the   rule   of   law   to  be   upheld    and    for  the\nprotection of the full and equal rights of all its people.\nSuperficial     attempts      at  reform      and    the   selective\napplication of judicial decisions erode the legitimacy\nand effectiveness of institutions of Government, which\nare the foundations of peace, justice and sustainable\ndevelopment. The same holds true for the Constitutional\nCourt, concerning which we call for full representation\nin the appointment of judges, including international\njudges, whose wealth of knowledge and experience\ncan contribute richly towards advancing Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019s jurisprudence.\n     Thirdly    and    lastly,   we   welcome       the  efforts    of\nthe  Presidency,      the   Council      of  Ministers      and   the\nParliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand urge that the actions of their respective entities\nbe   aligned    with    national     development       aspirations,\nincluding     as   provided      for   in   the    Dayton      Peace\nAgreement. It is critical that State-level institutions\nreceive the necessary funding and support for their\noperations,     particularly      as   they    relate    to   public\ninfrastructure,      utility   and    service    delivery.    Sierra\nLeone is hopeful that the upcoming review of the\ncountry\u2019s accession status into the European Union,\nwith a view to advancing the negotiations, presents\nan opportunity for the authorities of the Federation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska to\nrenew their commitment towards taking the necessary\nsteps for integration into the EU and to refrain from\ninflexible positions during negotiations.\nIn conclusion, Sierra Leone commends the efforts\nof the Peacebuilding Fund in advancing the women\nand peace and security and the youth and peace and\nsecurity agendas and welcomes the operationalization\nof the Peacebuilding Steering Committee to sustain\npeacebuilding initiatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe commend the dedication of the European Union and\nthe international community towards the stabilization\nof  Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to urge\nconstructive cooperation in the best interests of all\nits people."

I also congratulate Switzerland on its successful conclusion of the presidency last month. I welcome His Excellency Denis Be\u0107irovi\u0107, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the representatives of Serbia, Croatia, and the European Union, at today\u2019s meeting.\nAn important country in the Balkans region, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been ravaged by war, and its people yearn for peace and tranquillity. Inclusive reconciliation and harmonious coexistence among all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina will help the country maintain peace and stability, achieve sustainable social and economic development and accelerate its integration in the European Union, meeting the shared expectations of countries in the region and the international community.\nChina welcomes the smooth conduct of the recent local elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which showcased inclusiveness and restraint among all ethnic groups, thereby creating a positive and favourable atmosphere for next year\u2019s general elections. At the same time, we note with concern that, for some time now, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been marked by occasional words and deeds that aggravate ethnic rivalries and undermine national unity, the national reconciliation process has encountered serious challenges and political divisions have become ever more glaring, rendering the situation ever more complex. We call on all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina to actively engage in dialogue, enhance mutual trust and work together to maintain the country\u2019s political and social stability, with a view to promoting national development and people\u2019s well-being. We call on the international community to adopt a fair, balanced and prudent approach on the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, fully heed the views and concerns of the three communities in the country and refrain from taking sides, imposing solutions, interfering in its internal affairs or even imposing unilateral sanctions.\nChina\u2019s position on the High Representative system and the appointment of the High Representative remains unchanged. We are concerned about the controversies that have arisen in recent years over the appointment of the High Representative and the use of the Bonn powers. Since the beginning of this year, Mr. Christian Schmidt has frequently used the Bonn powers to amend the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, giving rise to tensions and divisions within the country, as well as controversies. I would like to reiterate that the affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina should ultimately be decided and managed by the people of the country themselves. Both the High Representative system and the Bonn powers are special arrangements for a special era. As such, they cannot be considered long-term, let alone permanent.\nChina\u2019s position on the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina is consistent and clear. We respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the independent choice of its people for the future of the country. We encourage all ethnic communities to actively engage in constructive dialogue and work towards national inclusiveness and reconciliation. We continue to hope that all parties will put the interest of the country and the people first and work together to maintain the political stability of the country.\nChina appreciates the constructive roles played by Serbia, Croatia and other countries in the region in maintaining the security and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcomes the renewal of the mandate of the European Union military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. China will remain committed to developing friendly relations with the people of all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to playing a constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region."

I welcome as well the presence\nat this meeting of Mr. Denis Be\u0107irovi\u0107, Chairman\nof the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nand the representatives of Serbia, Croatia and the\nEuropean Union.\n      I would like first and foremost to emphasize\nAlgeria\u2019s clear and consistent position on the situation\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is based on respect\nfor the country\u2019s sovereignty, independence and\nterritorial integrity, in accordance with the purposes\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and\ninternational law.\n      We also welcome the unanimous adoption by the\nCouncil of resolution 2757 (2024), which renews the\nauthorization for the European Union military operation\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of 12 months.\n      We express our satisfaction with regard to the\nholding of local elections on 6 October, despite the\nchallenges faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina following\nthe catastrophic floods in the country, which resulted in\nsignificant human and material losses. That important\ndemocratic event for all the constituents of the\ncountry could strengthen the participation of all in the\ndecision-making process. It also could enable the country\nto reach an effective political landscape that would allow\nit to advance along the path of stability and development.\n      We are totally convinced that democracy in\nBosnia and Herzegovina will also contribute to\nachieving solutions that are owned by various country\ncomponents and bring together the divergent and\nsometimes conflicting points of view. In that context,\nAlgeria reiterates its full support for State-owned\nsolutions to the issues the country is facing. At the\nsame time, Algeria calls for refraining from any actions\nor behaviours that could jeopardize the progress made\nby Bosnia and Herzegovina as a country in which\nBosnians, Croatians and Serbians live side by side in\nharmony and under sovereign, unified institutions.\n      My delegation would like to focus on the\nfollowing points.\n      First, Algeria considers the Dayton Peace\nAgreement the only consensual basis containing\nprovisions vital to Bosnia and Herzegovina. We call on\neveryone to respect its letter and spirit and adhere to its\nprovisions with a view to bringing the country to safety.\n      Secondly, it is natural for various political actors in\nthe country to have different opinions and assessments,\nbut those differences and political tensions should not\ndeviate from the path of democracy or threaten the\nunity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n      Thirdly and lastly, it is clear that political divisions\nand differences of opinion among the country\u2019s\nstakeholders could prolong the current phase and delay\nthe process of reconciliation and progress that everyone\naspires to.\n      Therefore, it is important for everyone to be guided\nby a constructive and inclusive dialogue and to take\ninto account the different points of view to enrich the\nfruitful discussion and not to choose discrimination and\nself-absorption which often lead to political deadlock.\nOnly through constructive and good-faith dialogue, as\nwell as inclusive and genuine negotiations, will it be\npossible to overcome political differences and bridge\nthe gap among the divergent views in order to move\nforward towards a better future."

This development\nserves as a sobering reminder that maintaining peace is\nan ongoing effort that requires constant vigilance and\nunwavering commitment.\n      We are of the view that the current situation\nrequires continued collaborative action at the local,\nnational and international levels to overcome the\nchallenges emanating from the country\u2019s complex\nhistorical legacy, diverse demographic composition and\n\ncurrent political landscape. We commend the dialogue\nfor peace session\u2019s approach of extending beyond urban\ncentres and actively involving all citizens, particularly\nwomen and youth, as doing so constitutes an essential\nfoundation for sustainable peace. Their perspectives\nand contributions are invaluable in forging more\ninclusive and enduring solutions.\n     The General Framework Agreement for Peace in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton\nAccords, marked a crucial and decisive milestone\nin ending the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, we emphasize that true peace extends beyond\nlegal agreements, requiring the cultivation of a culture\nof peace and tolerance, bridging ethnic divisions and\nembedding those principles in the fabric of society.\nWhile legal frameworks can set the stage, it is social\ncohesion that sustains lasting harmony. It is in that\nregard that we wish to echo the voices of Council\nmembers in congratulating Bosnia and Herzegovina\nfor the successful conduct of its local elections.

And allow\nme to thank Switzerland for its presidency in October.\n     We would like to express our condolences to Bosnia\nand Herzegovina in connection with those who died in\nthe natural disaster that has befallen them, resulting\nin the loss of life. We would also like to express our\ncondolences to Serbia in relation to today\u2019s tragic events\nin Novi Sad. National mourning has been declared in\nSerbia for tomorrow.\n     We     supported      the   adoption     of   the    resolution\nextending the mandate of the European Union Military\nOperation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea)\nfor a further 12-month period (resolution 2757 (2024).\nWe    start   from    the   assumption      that   that   Operation\nEUFOR-Althea is not a participant in internal Bosnian\nprocesses. The European forces should not interfere in\nthe political affairs of a sovereign State, and they must\ncarry out the tasks entrusted to them by the international\ncommunity in such a manner so as not to inflict harm\non the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and not to\nprovoke an exacerbation of the situation.\n     The Security Council, which has the situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina in its purview under Chapter\nVII of the Charter of the United Nations, is considering\nit now for the third time in a year. That speaks to the\npressing state of affairs on the ground vis-\u00e0-vis the\nmandate of the Security Council. Despite the absence\nat present of direct threats to peace and security in the\ncountry, the destructive situation fomented by Western\nactors    around     the   General      Framework       Agreement\nfor Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, also known as\nthe Dayton Accords, has a great deal of destabilizing\npotential that could lead to the escalation of inter-ethnic\nstrife and could disrupt the fragile stability in the Balkans.\n\n     We have repeatedly drawn the attention of Security\nCouncil     members        to  the    erosion    of   key    Dayton\nprinciples ensuring the equality of the three constituent\npeoples and the two entities, Republika Srpska and\nthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with broad\nconstitutional powers. Those actions, including those\ninspired from outside, have undermined the role of\nthe presidency in the country as the supreme voice\nof the consensus position of the multi-ethnic Bosnia-\nHerzegovinian        society   on   key    issues   for   the  State.\nThey     have    formed      a   parallel,    extraconstitutional,\nunlawful and anti-democratic scheme for the adoption\nand implementation of decisions on behalf of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina by representatives of only one of\nthe   peoples.    This    flagrant    violation    of  the   Dayton\nAgreement is taking place at the behest of Western\ncountries, which consider themselves the guarantors of\nthe 1995 peace agreement, endorsed by resolution 1031\n(1995).\n     The     most     glaring    example      was     the   General\nAssembly\u2019s       consideration,      on    23   May     (see   A/78/\nPV.82), of the flawed text of resolution 78/282, on the\nInternational Day of Reflection and Commemoration of\nthe 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica. The resolution was\nnot supported by even half of the population of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina or by half of the United Nations\nMember States. As we said during the Security Council\nmeeting on 15 May (see S/PV.9626), the draft resolution\nwould not provide any reconciliation to the country and\ncannot do so, even in principle. The main thing \u2014 the\nconsensus of the country\u2019s peoples             \u2014 is missing, not\nto  mention      the  legal   inadequacy       of  that   initiative.\nHowever, that did not stop the Western guardians,\nled by Germany, from trying to push through their\nprovocative draft in the General Assembly at any cost.\n     The motives behind those attempts to undermine\nDayton through fait accompli policies are well-known.\nThat is being done in order to centralize Bosnia and\nHerzegovina       and   turn   it  into   a  unitary    State   fully\ncontrolled by the West. The postulates endorsed by the\nSecurity Council are being replaced by NATO values,\nwhich are cunningly being presented as a panacea for\nall problems. It is unbecoming, and it is ridiculous to\nhear this sort of thing from NATO countries after the\nhavoc they wreaked in the Balkans in 1995 and 1999,\ndropping depleted uranium bombs on civilians and\ncivilian objects. Of course, they are doing all they can\nto conceal those facts. That is evidenced by the fact\nthat in March they twice put to a vote Russia\u2019s request\nfor   a  Security      Council     meeting      to  commemorate\nthe   twenty-fifth     anniversary      of  NATO\u2019s       aggression\nagainst Yugoslavia.\nAll these feverish actions by Western countries have nothing to do with the interests of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The preliminary results of the 6 October municipal elections indicate that the overwhelming majority of the country\u2019s citizens fully support the Dayton system for ensuring their national interests, which is the cornerstone of the architecture of regional and European security. The international community has no right to ignore that sovereign choice. We call on our colleagues in the Security Council to support it as well.\nOn the other hand, if anything does need changing, it is the Office of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a relic of the past. Not only is the Office failing to facilitate independent dialogue among the three peoples, but \u2014 through its totally inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 it is also inflicting colossal damage to the process of post-conflict settlement, wiping out all progress made by the international community to that end. The Office has long exhausted its functions and has become an instrument of colonial policies. It must therefore be shut down as soon as possible. It is no surprise that criticism of the so-called High Representative has been growing recently, even in the sectors of Bosnian society that previously, with the permissiveness of Western countries, saw him as a conduit for their interests. Council members need to send a clear message that the Office\u2019s stance is categorically unacceptable and that there is no alternative to intra-Bosnian dialogue. There can be no doubt that the future of the country\u2019s peoples is exclusively in their own hands.\nIn that connection, we also propose a critical approach to the biased and one-sided assessments of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Office of the High Representative and German citizen Mr. Schmidt, who usurped the post of the High Representative. The pseudo-High Representative\u2019s detachment from reality is evident in his so-called \u201creport\u201d, solely aimed at creating a false impression about the state of affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to shift responsibility for the crisis onto those who are actually defending the Dayton principles. A simple and sober analysis suffices to understand the real picture, including the fact that there are no threats emanating from Republika Srpska. What deserves the Council\u2019s attention is the anti-democratic measures being taken against political opponents, who, for more than a year now have been facing a blatantly fabricated trial on completely absurd charges. I will not even talk here about the imposition by the United States and the United Kingdom of unlawful unilateral sanctions against the leadership of Republika Srpska in order to exert political pressure on them. The absurd nature of those steps is obvious. A primer for Security Council members could be the material prepared by the Government of Republika Srpska, containing objective information on the situation on the ground, which we circulated yesterday in the Council.\nNext year, the Dayton Peace Agreement will mark its thirtieth anniversary. At this important milestone, it is essential that the priorities of the international community in the Bosnia and Herzegovina remain the comprehensive strengthening of the Dayton architecture, promoting the principles of equal rights for the three constituent peoples and the two entities, getting rid of the Office of the High Representative and ensuring that the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina have the right to independent development.\nFor its part, Russia, as one of the guarantor States of 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, stands ready for constructive cooperation in order to ensure a genuine post-conflict settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

                "representative": "Mr. Mart",
                "country": "Serbia",
                "statement": "I congratulate you, Madam President, and the United Kingdom on assuming the presidency of the Council for the month of November. I would also like to thank Switzerland for its presidency of the Council in the month of October.\n\nThe stability of the region and overall cooperation with neighbours are among Serbia\u2019s key foreign policy priorities. In that regard, my country attaches special attention to planning and implementing the common projects through which we seek to build a true perspective for a better future. In terms of cooperation, Bosnia and Herzegovina is among Serbia\u2019s most valuable partners.\n\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement is of exceptional and lasting importance. It is the foundation on which everything has been achieved in Bosnia and Herzegovina to date. It is also the lasting basis on which to build peace and stability and the starting point of efforts to reach the goal of genuine reconciliation and mutual understanding. However, reconciliation requires focus and application rather than voices and messages reminiscent of the past. Regrettably, the objectives to which we once signed up serve only to multiply problems between Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s entities and among its constituent peoples, and needless to say they also affect the political atmosphere in the region. Unilateral acts often taken by certain political actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the lack of effort on their part to achieve prior consensus and wider regional agreement on important issues that may be contentious are dangerous practices that lead to new divisions and widen the split among the constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSerbia is committed to overall cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina and with its entities. Cooperation and activities leading to reconciliation should always be borne in mind by all politicians in the region at all levels of Government. That is the only way forward towards achieving the progress expected by all of us in the region. Special mention in that context should be made of my country\u2019s continued and consistent respect for the principles of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States. Respect for those principles and our mutual respect are of lasting value in relations between neighbours, and Serbia unreservedly supports the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the stability of that country.\n\nWe consider that dialogue and agreement on the ongoing and long-standing issues on which there exist differences between Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s entities and among its constituent peoples are the best way to ensure their solution. However, disregard for the principle of consensus and the selective use of the country\u2019s common institutions do not help to build confidence between those entities and among those peoples. Practice has shown that progress in overcoming differences is achievable only if solutions are acceptable, and therefore implementable. By the same token, that is also the right way to achieve progress in the process of building mutual confidence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nMy country believes that it is in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s best interests for all its laws to be in accordance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the Dayton Peace Agreement. At the same time, we support a genuine and open dialogue within Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we are convinced that it is possible to create conditions for reaching an agreement and solutions that are acceptable for all. The policy of taking one-sided acts that are fraught with negative messages and attempts to impose positions and create divisions and problems is not a part of the quest to respond to the lasting interests of all Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s citizens. Serbia is committed to genuine reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to which it has made, and continues to make, a visible contribution through its responsible policy and its consistent respect for the Dayton Peace Agreement.\nAs a country whose membership of the European\nUnion is one of its foreign policy priorities, Serbia\nsupports Bosnia and Herzegovina along its path towards\nEuropean Union membership and salutes each and every\nsuccess it achieves in the process of European integration.\nWe recommit to sharing experiences and assistance\non that path. To that end, we stand ready to develop\never-more comprehensive cooperation \u2014 in particular\neconomic cooperation \u2014 with our neighbour Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, in all areas of interest to the two countries.\nEspecially important in that respect is the modernization\nof road and rail corridors. Large infrastructure projects,\nsuch as the Belgrade to Sarajevo motorway, are open to\nparticipation by third countries as well.\nWe also believe that there is room for the promotion\nof our overall relations in all areas of common interest.\nMy country supports the development of relations with\nBosnia and Herzegovina, just as it supports its territorial\nintegrity. We consider, however, that the provisions of\nthe Dayton Peace Agreement should be fully honoured\nand the interests of Republika Srpska respected. After\nall, those are the basic conditions for stability in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and the region as a whole.\nBefore I conclude, allow me to say a few words in\nthe light of some of the hallucinatory remarks made by\none of the speakers who preceded me.\nFirst, the initiation and adoption in May of General\nAssembly resolution 78/282, entitled \u201cInternational Day\nof Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide\nin Srebrenica\u201d, was a dry run for consensus disregard\nat the country level in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It\nwas a rejection of dialogue and a selective use of the\ncommon institutions of that country. The initiative,\nwhich was embarked upon unilaterally by one Bosniak\nside, without internal consensus in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and contrary to its Constitution and laws\nas well as the Dayton Peace Agreement, was \u2014 as we\nwitnessed \u2014 harmful to the process of reconciliation,\nconfidence-building and prosperity and set that process\nback considerably. I recall that all of Serbia\u2019s efforts are\naimed at achieving consensus and meaningful results,\nnamely, showing respect, remembering the victims and\nensuring that horrendous crimes are never repeated and\nthat efforts are continued in the places where crimes\nwere committed in order to bring about reconciliation\nand build a common future.\nSecondly, as has been the case so far, it is Serbia\u2019s\nundisguised intention to develop transparent relations\nwith Republika Srpska under the Dayton Peace\nAgreement. The cooperation, as defined by the Agreement\non Special Parallel Relations between the Republic of\nSerbia and Republika Srpska, is aimed at promoting the\nsocial, democratic and economic development of Serbia\nand Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\nwhole and our region. The All-Serbian Sabor that was\nheld in Belgrade on 8 June should be understood and\nconstrued accordingly."

We thank the High Representative for\nBosnia and Herzegovina for the sixty-sixth report,\nand we take note of his assessment that local elections\nwere successfully conducted without serious incidents.\nWe regret that, during the reporting period, there was\nno major progress in the area of European integration,\nespecially bearing in mind that Bosnia and Herzegovina\nhad implemented a number of important reforms in\nthe previous period. We hope that, following the local\nelections, the country will refocus on its reform and\nEuropean agenda. We sincerely believe that European\nintegration offers the best development opportunity for\nBosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens.\nWe fully agree with the conclusion of the High\nRepresentative that the General Framework Agreement\nfor Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and European\nintegration are complementary and mutually reinforcing.\nWhile Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to undergo\nsubstantial transformation to become a successful\nEuropean Union (EU) member State, the Dayton Peace\nAgreement remains a cornerstone of its constitutional\norder and political stability. Any in-depth changes to\nthat will require appropriate democratic legitimization\nand the support of all three constituent peoples of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nWork on constitutional and electoral reform should\nbe continued and completed as a matter of priority. We\nare convinced that only full respect for the principles of\nequality among constituent peoples and all citizens\u2019 right\nto non-discrimination can bring about lasting political\nstability to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nCroatia, as its immediate EU neighbour, looks\nforward to the next steps by Bosnia and Herzegovina\non its path to the European Union.

But I would like to underline a\nfew facts as a quick response to some of the points, one\nagain relating to the denial of the Srebrenica genocide\nand another to the declaration adopted by the All-\nSerb Assembly.\nHe mentioned the future that we would create if\nwe worked together on reconciliation, the protection of\nhuman rights and upholding international law. There\nappears to be selective amnesia about the activities of\nthe same Serbia just few months ago. They were in the\nforefront of the shameful campaign demonizing the\nresolution calling for an international day for the victims\nof the Srebrenica genocide (General Assembly resolution\n78/282). The judgement of the International Court of\nJustice was based on the very same international law\nthat the Serbian defence once bluntly denied, when\nthe victims of the Serbian genocide were belittled and\ndenied by the institutional machinery employed in denial\nof legally established facts, with the aim of scaring the\ninternational community about new conflicts in the\nBalkans. They should never forget that never again will\ntheir flagrant disregard for international law \u2014 and\nnot just on that occasion \u2014 speak as loudly as their\ncommitment to upholding it. The Republic of Serbia is\nthe only State in history to have violated the Convention\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of\nGenocide, and they have limited historical, political,\nmoral or civilized leeway to preach to others about that\nparticular aspect.\nWith regard to the declaration, I just want to say, for\nrecord, that I have here the declaration that we are talking\nabout. I warmly suggest to our colleagues from Serbia\nthat they might circulate it so that everyone can see just\nhow clear the violation of the Dayton Peace Accord is. I\nwill not repeat the words of President Be\u0107irovi\u0107, but it is\nvery clear that this represents the road map to the project\nfor a greater Serbia of the previous century, whose main\nauthors in that attempt three decades ago were sentenced\nfor war crimes at the International Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia, including the genocide at Srebrenica. This\nis the road map for the destruction of the Dayton Peace\nAccord. This is the road map for the implementation of\nexclusive national territories within Europe, instead of us\nintegrating into the European Union, by proponents, as\nI said, who were already judged by international courts\nestablished in this building and by the court of history."

Serbia is oriented towards the future.\nThis is somebody who is using every opportunity to\nattack the leadership of Serbia and using words such\nAnschluss, and others. We know what that means. But it\nis not good for the future of our region. I want to repeat\nagain that Serbia respects the territorial integrity of\nBosnia Herzegovina. We want the rights of all nations\nand peoples living there to be respected, but they are not\nin fact being respected. Representatives of other sides\nshould be representing all three nations, not just one.\nThat is a very dangerous thing for our future. As I said,\ntheir inflammatory language attacking the leadership\nof Serbia, completely without evidence, is completely\nunacceptable. Serbia is committed. President Vu\u010di\u0107 has\nbeen in New York four times this year to explain and\nshow why Serbia is dedicated to peace and stability and\nwhy we want to work on peace and stability, because that\nis the only way that can be done.

Underlines the importance of an inclusive, comprehensive national dialogue and victim-centred reconciliation process based on the principles of transitional justice, welcomes the efforts of the Presidential Council to launch the national reconciliation process, and the support of the African Union in that regard, and encourages further progress on national reconciliation, recognises the important role of other regional organisations, including the League of Arab States and the European Union, and calls upon the relevant Libyan institutions and authorities to implement confidence-building measures to create an environment conducive for successful national presidential and parliamentary elections, including by ensuring the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women, and inclusion of youth and civil society representatives, in all activities and decision-making relating to democratic transition and reconciliation efforts;\n8.

                "statement": "I have the honour to deliver this joint explanation of vote on behalf of the three African members of the Security Council, namely, Algeria, Sierra Leone and my own country, Mozambique, as well as Guyana (A3+).\nThe A3+ wishes to express its gratitude to the United Kingdom for its pivotal role in proposing the resolution to renew the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). The careful consideration of our priorities has been paramount, and we appreciate the reflection of those priorities in the text before us. We have voted in favour of resolution 2755 (2024) as a demonstration of our strong support for UNSMIL\u2019s crucial role in Libya. We underscore the importance of preserving the unity and solidarity of the Council, especially at this critical juncture in Libya. Our collective commitment in supporting the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya is vital. We welcome the reaffirmation of the Security Council\u2019s stance to respect these principles and the need to refrain from external interference in Libya. It is our responsibility to stand firmly with the people of Libya as they navigate this challenging period.\nWe are committed to Libya\u2019s stability. We believe that UNSMIL\u2019s continued presence is vital in facilitating inclusive presidential and parliamentary elections, national dialogue and reconciliation. In that context, we consider the prompt appointment of a new Special Representative of the Secretary-General as crucial for achieving this objective. It would ensure continuity and effective leadership in supporting Libya\u2019s peace process.\nIn line with our steadfast support for the renewal of UNSMIL\u2019s mandate, during the negotiations we advocated for a standard straightforward 12-month renewal period. That would provide stability and predictability and would enhance the effectiveness of UNSMIL\u2019s work. The A3+ believes that a longer renewal period would strengthen the Mission\u2019s ability to support Libya\u2019s political and peace processes.\nHowever, in the light of the views and concerns expressed in the course of negotiations and in order to maintain the unity and cohesion of the Council in its support for UNSMIL, the A3+ has demonstrated enough flexibility by accepting the proposal reflected in the resolution just adopted. In that regard, we note the eventual automatic extension, for an additional nine months, conditioned on the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We therefore urge Council members to show their support for Libya\u2019s stability by agreeing to a regular mandate when the current mandate expires, taking into account the strategic review to be submitted by the Secretary-General.\nThe A3+ supports a Libyan-led and -owned process aligned with the international efforts. We therefore call for stronger language backing elections and a referendum in Libya. We believe that empowering the Libyan people\u2019s voice through referendum provisions can constructively break the impasse and advance the political process. That will also prioritize their aspirations for peace and stability. The Libyan people have the right to determine their destiny, to choose their leaders and to manage their wealth and resources. They must be afforded the opportunity to shape their future, as stated in the address by the President of the Presidential Council of Libya to the General Assembly on September 2024 (see A/79/PV.9).\nIn addition, we welcome the call for full compliance by all Member States with the arms embargo decision. All States must refrain from taking actions that could exacerbate the conflict and divisions in Libya. That includes the swift withdrawal from Libya of all foreign forces, fighters and mercenaries so as to create an environment that is conducive to progress on the political and security fronts.\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our support for an effective and credible election process, underpinned by a sound constitutional and legal framework as a necessary condition for Libya\u2019s peace, stability and development."

                "statement": "The current political situation in Libya remains complex, and the Libyan parties still have differences in promoting the political transition and the unification of State institutions. Against that backdrop, China votes in favour of resolution 2755 (2024), extending the mandate of UNSMIL, and encourages the Mission to continue its mediation efforts so as to help the Libyan parties bridge their political differences, build political consensus and move beyond the political impasse as soon as possible.\nThanks to sustained and joint efforts, the members of the Council have reached consensus on issues such as the duration of the mandate renewal. China welcomes the constructive attitude demonstrated by the parties concerned. It is worth noting that during consultations, many members expressed varying degrees of concern about the long-standing vacancy in the position of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya. The resolution just adopted calls for the appointment of a new Special Representative as soon as possible. China hopes that the United Nations will expedite the selection and appointment process, with full consideration of the views of the countries concerned and the major stakeholders so that UNSMIL can better perform its duties in a comprehensive manner.\nAt the same time, China supports, in principle, a strategic review of UNSMIL, as mandated by the resolution. We hope that the United Nations will adhere to the principles of objectivity, transparency and pragmatism when conducting the review and put forward practical recommendations for UNSMIL to further adjust and optimize its presence in Libya, within existing financial and human resources, and improve the efficiency of its mandate delivery."

Japan also welcomes the Council members\u2019 constructive engagement to find the best way to empower the Mission.\nJapan voted in favour of the resolution given the crucial role that UNSMIL continues to play in supporting and facilitating the Libyan-led and -owned\nThe situation in Libya\n31/10/2024\n\ninclusive political process, which will renew the legitimacy of Libyan institutions and pave the way to peace and stability in Libya and the region.\nAgainst that backdrop, Japan, along with the vast majority of Council members, clearly supported a 12-month renewal of the mandate, during our negotiations, in order to allow the Mission to fully and smoothly carry out its mandate at this critical juncture for Libya. Japan therefore regrets that the resolution adopted just now extends the mandate for only three months, which could have a negative impact on the work done by the Mission on the ground, even though it comes with a conditional automatic renewal. Japan stresses the urgent need for the members of the Council to be united in further empowering the Mission.\nI would like to seize this opportunity to reaffirm Japan\u2019s full support for the Mission. Japan calls on Libyan stakeholders and other Member States to join us in supporting the Mission\u2019s work so that Libya can successfully complete its political transition.\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my country\u2019s steadfast commitment to the Libyan people. As a responsible Member State, Japan is willing to contribute to the Organization\u2019s efforts to support Libya even after the completion of our current term on the Security Council."

                "statement": "The Russian Federation supported resolution 2755 (2024), submitted by the United Kingdom, on extending the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) for three months.\nA decisive argument in favour of our decision was the fact that a subsequent extension of the mandate for nine months, as stated in the text of the document, would occur only if the Secretary-General appoints a Special Representative for Libya country and Head of UNSMIL by 31 January 2025.\nWe share the position of our colleagues that the United Nations plays a leading role in the configuration of mediation efforts in Libya. A key component of those efforts is UNSMIL. However, the Mission\u2019s transition period, regrettably, is taking longer than expected. We have not had a main Security Council-appointed United Nations negotiator since April, which limits the Missions\u2019 tools to support the Libyan dialogue and complicates the resolution of the pressing problems connected to the Libyan settlement.\nFurther delays are unacceptable against the backdrop of the extensive period of dual power in the former Jamahiriya. The situation risks pushing the country to the brink, beyond which lies the potential resumption of the armed conflict. Our principled position for the earliest possible appointment of the Head of the Mission is dictated solely by our concern for maintaining the effectiveness of United Nations efforts to facilitate a settlement in Libya. The longer the current uncertainty persists, the larger the web of problems entangling this country will become. This state of affairs does not encourage the Libyan parties to continue constructive work aimed at uniting the country and its State institutions.\nWe expect the Secretary-General to promptly submit for consideration by the Security Council a worthy and authoritative candidate for the position of Special Representative for Libya and Head of UNSMIL. The candidate must be agreeable to the main Libyan players and the key regional players. The Mission needs a leader who will enjoy the true trust of all parties. We expect that the Secretary-General will take seriously the signal contained in the resolution adopted by the Council today."

                "statement": "Let me first thank the United Kingdom for the inclusive and flexible manner in which it conducted the negotiations on resolution 2755 (2024), unanimously adopted just now.\nThe United States welcomes the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), but we are disappointed that negotiations did not result in the year-long mandate we called for at the 15 October briefing, and which the vast majority of Council members support. Russia\u2019s intransigence during negotiations is the sole reason we do not have a straightforward, one-year mandate that strengthens UNSMIL\u2019s ability to move Libya towards stability and an inclusive peace \u2014 and we can only speculate as to why Russia seeks to hobble this vital Mission.\nUNSMIL is an essential partner in Libya, having brokered the agreement that resolved the leadership crisis at the Central Bank of Libya. Restoring the political process requires similar types of compromises. As we saw during a period in 2022, revisiting the mandate every few months stalled progress on UNSMIL\u2019s long-term plans to develop sustainable solutions to the\nchallenges in Libya. This year, the United Kingdom\nonce again had a challenging role as the penholder, and\nits engagements resulted in important additions.\nThis resolution includes a new operative clause that\nwill automatically extend UNSMIL\u2019s mandate for nine\nmonths if a new Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral is appointed on or before 31 January 2025. The\nUnited States has faith that the Secretary-General will\nappoint a qualified Special Representative that works\nfor the best interests of the Libyan people. Indeed, we\nunderstand there was a qualified candidate who could\nhave been appointed earlier this year. Until such time as\nthe position is filled on a permanent basis, the Council\nmust continue to offer our full support for UNSMIL\u2019s\ncurrent leadership and its efforts to establish a Libyan-\nled path to free and fair elections as soon as possible.\nTo do that, the Council must send a clear message that\na short-term renewal does not allow spoilers to retrench\nto the status quo or worse. That is why we strongly\nsupport language in the resolution and the Council\u2019s\nlatest press statement (SC/15804) to that effect.\nWhile Russia has regrettably forced us to choose\nbetween an imperfect resolution or no resolution, the\nadoption of this resolution today ensures that UNSMIL\nwill continue working on behalf of the Libyan people\nfor a better future that they deserve.\nThe meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.\nS/PV.9770  The situation in Libya  31/10/2024\n\n6/6                                   24-32465"

and Lasting Peace (the Final Agreement), urging the parties, with the support of relevant state institutions and security forces, as well as civil society including women and youth, to work together to continue building upon this progress and address ongoing challenges, in particular the continued violence in conflict-affected areas, through comprehensive implementation of the Final Agreement,

In addition, providing accurate information concerning such incidents directly strengthens Colombia\u2019s ability to develop and implement effective national strategies to prevent sexual and gender-based violence, a goal that deserves our unwavering support.\n      As     this     will     be    Switzerland\u2019s           last    intervention on Colombia as a member of the Council, I would like to stress that our commitment to the Colombian peace       process       will     remain        firm.      Switzerland           will continue to support the full implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace and will gladly assume its responsibilities as a guarantor and supporting country of the peace talks.\n      I resume my functions as President of the Council.\n      I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia."

                "statement": "I thank Her Excellency Mrs. Pascale Baeriswyl, Permanent Representative of Switzerland and President of the Security Council, for her continued support, with a constant focus on the central role and empowerment of women and the implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace. I also thank Dame Barbara Woodward, Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom and penholder on the Colombia dossier, for her invaluable support and leadership in the Security Council, while always underscoring Colombia\u2019s participation, and for spearheading and supporting this resolution (resolution 2754 (2024)). On behalf of the Colombian people, I thank them both.\n\nI would like to begin by highlighting the presence of our General Director of the National Planning Department of Colombia, Mr. Alexander L\u00f3pez Maya, who is with us today and who is heading budget and financing aspects related to the implementation of the historic 2016 agreement, in particular the rapid response plan for its implementation. I am grateful to each and every member of the Security Council for their unanimous support for peace in Colombia, the implementation of the historic 2016 peace agreement and the Colombian Government\u2019s \u201ctotal peace\u201d policy that is centred on victims, territories, ethnic groups, farmers, women, children, adolescents and youth.\n\nThat support is of particular relevance in the context of the sixteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is currently being held in Cali under the theme Peace with Nature. It is a historic event during which the country and the world can reaffirm their commitment to peace that transcends borders and encompasses the preservation of our biodiversity. Peace with nature is also peace with people.\n\nPursuant to resolution 2754 (2024), the extension of mandate of the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia until 31 October 2025 is very meaningful for us and clearly demonstrates the continued and unanimous support of the international community, especially the Council, for building peace and stability in our country.\n\nThis year has been special in terms of the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement, in particular with regard to the Council, which had the opportunity to visit Colombia and learn at first-hand about our efforts to that end. Accordingly, I invite Council members to celebrate another anniversary of the peace agreement that will take place in Oslo, as Norway is a guarantor of the peace agreement. It has indeed been a very special year. Obviously, the national Government carried out a precise and transparent evaluation of the progress in the implementation of the agreement, as well as the challenges. For example, we made progress on the bilateral aspects of the agreement, which included the participation of the President of the Republic and a representative of the high contracting party of the peace agreement signatories at one of several meetings. The President explained to Council members the challenges that we face and announced the rapid response plan to overcome them. And, on 15 October, the rapid response plan to accelerate the implementation of the 2016 peace agreement was introduced.\n\nWe are aware of the challenges we face, but with the same resolve that was announced on 11 July, we are convinced that we have taken the appropriate measures to overcome them. The national Government\u2019s commitment to peace is evident in its political and budgetary decisions. For the four years of the current Government, investments were estimated at more than 14 billion pesos, which is integral to fulfilling the terms of agreement and exceeds by 1 billion pesos the resources that were made available in previous periods. As of August 2024, we have increased investment and budgetary allocations through the national investment for peace budget, and 40 per cent of the resources necessary have been committed.\n\nPeace in Colombia is a process that is in motion and cannot be reversed. To that end, we will continue working to fulfil the agreement, transform the territories and spread peace throughout the country. Peace in Colombia is not only a national goal, but also an opportunity that we share with the world. We have the best ally in the world to build peace in Colombia \u2014 the United Nations. We have before us today a unique opportunity. The support and collaboration of the Security Council are invaluable. Let us work together for peace so that every step towards reconciliation translates into hope and opportunities in the daily lives of our people.\n\nThe meeting rose at 3.25 p.m."

We are confident that UNTMIS will work in close coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia and the successor mission to the African Union Transition\nThe A3+ therefore voted in favour of the resolution just adopted, with a view to advancing the effective implementation of the Federal Government of Somalia\u2019s security sector plan and its national transformation plan, which are both critical for the security of Somalia and the wider region. The adoption of this resolution reflects, in a concrete manner, our collective acknowledgement of the progress registered by the Federal Government of Somalia in many respects, with important United Nations support over a period of many years. Such support from the United Nations has reached a point to be adapted to the realities and the needs on the ground and the final objective of handing over the responsibilities to the host country, in line with the principles and regulations governing the United Nations presence, deployment and withdrawal.\nBefore arriving at the end date, it is necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the resolution to enable UNTMIS to support State-building processes, including the constitutional review and efforts to conduct free and fair elections through inclusive and transparent one person, one vote processes, including through capacity-building, technical assistance and policy guidance and the facilitation of dialogue to promote reconciliation.\nIn conclusion, the A3+ reiterates its unwavering support for Somalia and urges all partners to continue their collaborative efforts to support the country during this pivotal period. We also emphasize the importance of continuing to prioritize the interests of the Somali Government in the transitional process. Together, we can support Somalia to achieve lasting peace, security and development."

We continue to view the Mission\u2019s role as critical to peacebuilding, reform, reconciliation and rule of law priorities and ensuring that those efforts are done in coordination with security efforts. We welcome that the resolution effectively continues UNSOM\u2019s mandate from resolution 2705 (2023), including its field presence, while incorporating recommendations from the joint United Nations-Federal Government of Somalia strategic review, including measured phases in the transition.\nWe are glad that the resolution requires the Council to consider conditions on the ground before each phase, should the situation change or deteriorate. In addition, the resolution will allow the leadership of UNSOM/UNTMIS to exercise its good offices, encourage Somalia to make progress towards finalizing the constitution, prepare for free and fair national and local elections, advance political, national and local reconciliation and promote human rights, including women\u2019s political participation, the freedom of expression and the protection of journalists.\nAt the same time, we are disappointed about the reporting requirements. This is not the time to decrease the number of reports and briefings to the Council, especially when the Council is considering the future of a post-African Union Transition Mission in Somalia mission.\nFinally, let me add a word of appreciation to Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General Jim Swan for his years of service in Somalia.
