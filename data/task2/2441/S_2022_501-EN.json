Decides to appoint Mr. Serge Brammertz as Prosecutor of the International\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals with effect from 1 July 2022 until\n30 June 2024;\n2.     Urges States to cooperate fully with the Mechanism;\n3.     Continues to urge all States, especially States where fugitives are\nsuspected of being at large, to intensify their cooperation with and render all\nnecessary assistance to the Mechanism, in particular to achieve the arrest and\nsurrender of all remaining fugitives indicted by the ICTR as soon as possible and to\ncooperate to enforce sentences pronounced by the ICTR, ICTY and the Mechanism,\nand welcomes the continuing support already provided by States in this regard;\n4.     Notes with concern that despite reaching an earlier agreement, the\nMechanism continues to face problems in the relocation of acquitted persons and\nconvicted persons who have completed serving their sentence, emphasises the\nimportance of finding expeditious and durable solutions to these problems, including\nas part of a reconciliation process, encourages all efforts to that end, and, in this\nregard, reiterates its call upon all States to cooperate with and render all necessary\nassistance to the Mechanism;\n5.     Notes that decisions on the relocation of persons who have been acquitted\nor completed their sentences should take into account inter alia the readiness of the\nstate of origin to accept its nationals, the consent or any objections raised by the\nindividuals to be relocated and the availability of other relocation states;\n6.     Takes note of the recent judgments of the Mechanism and developments in\nlocating fugitives, commends the cooperation between the Mechanism, States and\ninternational organisations, which contributed to these developments, and recognises\nthese as important steps of cooperation with the Mechanism, in accordance with\nparagraph 3 of resolution 2529 (2020); and further notes the Prosecutor\u2019s findings on\n12 May 2022 and on 18 May 2022 of the deaths of Protais Mpiranya on 5 October\n2006 and Ph\u00e9n\u00e9as Munyarugarama on 28 February 2002 respectively, that Mpiranya\nwas the last fugitive of the ICTR expected to be tried before the Mechanism, and that\nthe remaining four fugitives indicted by the ICTR remain at large and are expected to\nbe tried by Rwanda, subject to the conditions set out in the relevant referral decisions;\n7.     Emphasises that, in view of the substantially reduced nature of the residual\nfunctions, the Mechanism was established to be a small, temporary and efficient\nstructure, whose functions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of\nstaff commensurate with its reduced functions, and, recognising in this regard the full\ncommitment to these elements expressed by the Mechanism, requests the Mechanism\nto continue to be guided in its activities by these elements;\n8.     Welcomes the report (S/2022/319) submitted by the Mechanism to the\nCouncil pursuant to its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2022/2) for the purposes of\nthe review of the progress of the work of the Mechanism, including in completing its\nfunctions, as required by paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010), and the report of\nthe Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the evaluation of the methods\nand work of the Mechanism (S/2022/148), taking note of the OIOS\u2019s conclusions on\nthe Mechanism\u2019s implementation of the OIOS recommendations and paragraph 9 of\nresolution 2529(2020);\n9.     Takes note of the work of the Mechanism to date, in particular\ndevelopment of a legal and regulatory framework, procedures, and working practices\nconsistent with the Statute of the Mechanism and drawing on lessons learned from\nand best practices of the ICTY and ICTR and of other tribunals, including use of\nrosters to ensure judges are utilized only when required, enabling judges to work remotely to the maximum extent possible, and minimizing the need for full bench participation in pre-trial and pre-appeal hearing work, in order to produce substantial reductions in the costs of judicial activities compared to those of the ICTY and ICTR, and commends the Mechanism for its efforts to produce such reductions;\n                 10.  Notes further the views and recommendations made with regard to the Mechanism\u2019s work by the Council\u2019s Informal Working Group on International Tribunals, as reflected in this resolution, and requests the Mechanism to take into account those views and implement the recommendations, and to continue to take steps to further enhance efficiency and effective and transparent management, in particular: (i) full implementation of the outstanding recommendations of the OIOS; (ii) production of clear and focused projections of completion timelines for all of the Mechanism\u2019s activities including, in particular, in relation to ongoing cases and the supervision of the enforcement of sentences at the earliest stage possible and disciplined adherence thereto; (iii) continued ensuring of geographic diversity and gender balance of staff, while ensuring continued professional expertise; (iv) continued implementation of a human resources policy consistent with its temporary mandate; (v) further reduction of costs, including through, but not limited to, flexible staff engagement; and (vi) coordination and information sharing across the three organs of the Mechanism on matters that affected them equally in order to ensure systematic thinking and planning about the future;\n                 11.  Calls upon the Mechanism, as part of its completion strategy, to provide options regarding the transfer of its remaining activities in due course;\n                 12.  Reiterates its request to the Mechanism to include in its six-monthly reports to the Council information on progress achieved in implementing this resolution, as well as detailed information on the staffing and overall posts of the Mechanism, respective workload and related costs with breakdown by division and detailed projections of the duration of residual functions based on available data;\n                 13.  Recalls the importance of ensuring the rights of persons detained on the authority of the Mechanism in accordance with applicable international standards, including those related to health care;\n                 14.  Recalls its encouragement to the Mechanism in resolution 2422 (2018) to consider an appropriate solution to the approach to early release of persons convicted by the ICTR, and notes that during the review period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2020, conditions on early release in appropriate cases were put in place and the Mechanism refined procedures in this regard;\n                 15.  Notes the conclusion of the Council\u2019s review of the progress of the work of the Mechanism, including in completing its functions, since the last review of the Mechanism in June 2020, pursuant to resolution 1966 (2010);\n                 16.  Recalls, with a view to strengthening independent oversight of the Mechanism, that, as set out in its Presidential Statement ( S/PRST/2022/2), future reviews carried out pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010) shall include evaluation reports sought from the OIOS with respect to the methods and work of the Mechanism;\n                 17.  Decides to remain seized of the matter.\n"
